# Insertion sort vs Bubble sort
Due to the same nature to bubble element, these two sorting algorithm sounds the same which cause confusion.

Following are similarities
1. Both sorting algorithms do scanning from right to left
2. Both sorting algorithms try to bubble out element
3. Both are in place algorithm.

Following are differences
1. Insertion sort is based on the assumption that if the array is already sorted then how to insert the new item.
2. Bubble sort doesn't assume that array is already sorted
3. Due to the nature of the insertion sort, it can be written recursively.
4. Insertion sort try to bubble out new element to its correct position in sorted array.
5. Bubble sort tries to bubble out the new smallest element and place it to the first position in the context of the array start position.
